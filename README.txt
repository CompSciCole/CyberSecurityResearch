This Documentation was created to provide a public service in the way of Cyber Security. 
In this Documentation not only will we go over security vulnerabilities we have found but also teach you on how you can protect yourself more effectively and how to patch 
certain vulnerabilities that companies won't.

You will find 3 main Directories. 
1. Guides

This directory is for showing newer researchers how to setup certain environments like Virtual Machines in order to test software vulnerabilities.

2. Reports

This directory is for all reports made by this team in which we have found exploitable vulnerabilities and have informed the company affected via a report. The reports are and always will be public knowledge.

3. Walkthroughs

This will teach anyone who wishes to learn how to patch vulnerabilities without making it harder than it realistically needs to be. After all the best way to stay safe is to do it yourself.
